// Aaron Saroken, 10/7/22, Artistic masterpeice of Stewart Griffin.

//When presented with the oppertunity to express my artistic creativity
//in a coding class, as a teenage boy the awnser came right to me 
//to creat the man, the myth, the legend. Stewie. Griffin.
//Learning the ropes of creating unique shapes using 
//code and coordinates. After messing around with the coordintates
//I have gained an ability to correct the location of the shape
//if the shape does not start in the place I wanted.
//Since I am not the greatest coder instead of fearing mistakes
// I used the mistakes to help me improve and fix what
//I was doing before. I think that this project was very fun
//and let me realize I am able to learn a lot when I put my mind to it.
